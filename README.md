Shopping World: Your All-in-One Retail Manager
Shopping World is a bridge between a digital storefront and a backend warehouse. Built using Python and MySQL, it’s designed to handle the messy reality of retail—managing customers, tracking shifting stock levels, and generating instant bills—all from a clean, interactive command-line interface.

🌟 What can it do?
I designed this system to serve two different types of people: the shopper looking for a smooth experience and the admin who needs total control over the data.

# For the Customer: A Seamless Shopping Trip 
The customer side is all about getting from "browsing" to "bought" without any hiccups:

Personalized Accounts: New users can sign up in seconds, while returning customers can log straight back into their accounts.

Easy Discovery: Products are organized into clear categories like Fashion, Daily Essentials, and Electronics, making it easy to find exactly what you need.

Smart Shopping: The system acts like a real store clerk—it won’t let you buy more than what’s on the shelf. It validates stock levels in real-time.

Instant Receipts: No manual math required. Once you're done, the system generates a clean, professional-looking table showing your items and the total amount due.

For the Admin: Total Inventory Mastery
The admin side is the "engine room" where the store is managed and maintained:

Birds-Eye View: Admins can pull up the entire inventory at once to see what’s selling and what’s running low.

Full Creative Control: Easily add new product lines, adjust prices for sales, or restock items with a few keystrokes.

Data Cleanup: Old or discontinued products can be wiped from the system instantly to keep the database clutter-free.

Gatekeeping: A dedicated admin login ensures that sensitive inventory data and pricing are only accessible to authorized staff.
